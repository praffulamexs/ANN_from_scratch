# Artificial Neural Networks From Scratch

In this project, I will be creating an Artificial Neural Network from scratch.

## Purpose

I basically want to re-create what other Machine Learning and Deep Learning libraries already does. I want to allow the user of this project to use the classes built in this library to make a Neural Network or Deep Neural Neural Network of their own.

## How to run the project

Follow the step mentioned below and make sure you have all the required dependencies installed.

### Run the virtual environment
```
pipenv shell
```
